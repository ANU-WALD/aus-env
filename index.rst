Welcome to Aus-Env
##################

A data exploration website, showing the state of Australia's natural environment.

``aus-env`` is a javascript (angular+leaflet) frontend to selected data
from the `NCI Thredds server <http://dap.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog.html>`_,
using the WMS protocol and some custom magic.

It's a work in progress!
