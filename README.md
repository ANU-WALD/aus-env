This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

After you have cloned git to your local location, you may need to do some of the following:

1. Install Ruby (for sass stuff - mainly a windows thing).  [ruby installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
2. Run `install bower` from the aus-env root folder.
3. Run `gem install compass`

Recommend reboot after the gem installs.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
